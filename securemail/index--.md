Collaboration and file sharing web app

Role: Overall flow, UI design, Research, Usability studies

At Accellion I redesigned the secure file sharing web application to better support the various jobs customers were visiting the site for. While keeping the ability to share folders, I put more focus back on secure file sharing functions. I also incorporated patterns from web and desktop email applications in order to reduce training and increase a sense of familiarity for new users.

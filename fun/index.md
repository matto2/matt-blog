Thanks for sticking with me this far! As a reward I will now be sharing un-edited home videos from my youth - yes, I'm serious ðŸ˜Š - Some of these actually started out as 3.5" super 8 film reels that I converted to VHS a very long time ago.

Featuring magic in the dark, young Superman, and Aquaboy killing a shark!

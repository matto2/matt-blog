# Fun Stuff!

Thanks for sticking with me this far! As a reward I will now be sharing extremely amature home videos from my youth 😊 - Some of these started out as 3.5" super-8 reels that I converted to VHS a very long time ago (that's when the cheesy musak was added by the transfer service).

[• A young Superman](/img/superman.mp4)
[• Aquaboy kills a shark!](/img/aquaboy.mp4)
[• Old-surf-clips](/img/sm-barrel-and-lane.mp4)🏄‍♂️

<!-- Featuring magic in the dark, young Superman, and Aquaboy killing a shark! -->

<strong>Hi, I'm Matt! </strong><span class="emoji">ðŸ‘‹ </span>I have a varied background in designâ€“from founding a surf magazine to running production at creative agencies. Recently I created keeptheapostrophe.com with my father. I occasionally write about UX and other subjects on [Medium](https://medium.com/@mattosurf). Check out my resume [here](/img/OLeary_resume_2019.pdf).

My design process involves understanding customer and business goals via discussions and sketching out ideas with product owners. I then prototype, test and iterate based on feedback. I love discussing and testing with customers. Things I check for: is this useful, usable, understandable, accessible? I collaborate closely with Engineering and QA to build and test, then validate production versions with customers. Design isn't done until customers are getting their jobs done using your product.

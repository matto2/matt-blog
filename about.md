<img class="about-me"  src="/img/me-in-circle_purple.png">

My design process involves understanding customer and business goals via discussions and sketching out ideas with product owners. I then prototype, test and iterate based on feedback. I love discussing and testing with customers. Things I check for: is this useful, usable, understandable, accessible? I collaborate closely with Engineering and QA to build and test, then validate production versions with customers. Design isn't done until customers are getting their jobs done. Check out my [resume](/img/OLeary_resume_2020.pdf).


I have a varied background in designâ€“from founding a surf magazine to running production at creative agencies. Recently I created keeptheapostrophe.com with my father. I occasionally write about UX and other subjects on [Medium](https://medium.com/@mattosurf). I've also made a few [paintings](/paintings). I'm inspired by the California coast and can often be found [playing](/img/me-surfing_2019.mp4) in the waves or with my family on the beach. Happy to chat anytime about design, art, surfing, or the best food trucks in Santa Cruz!

I'm also a mentor at [Rookieup](https://www.rookieup.com/) and [Interaction Design Foundation's Get A UX Job Bootcamp](https://www.interaction-design.org/bootcamps/get-a-new-job-in-ux-design?ep=rookieup)

Update: I added a page to share some [~~fun random~~ self-indulgent things](/fun).

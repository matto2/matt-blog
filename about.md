<img class="about-me"  src="/img/me-in-circle_purple.png">

I am a lifelong artist, born in San Francisco and raised in Santa Cruz. I usually paint with acrylics on board or canvas. Surfing and the coast have been favorite subjects of my art ever since I was young. I draw inspiration from trips to Northern California, Big Sur, Hawaii, and beyond. Great art, excellent design, and publishing are all passions of mine. 

I co-founded The Juice, a regional surfing magazine, and have designed a few book covers. Currently, I work as a Digital Product Designer. I can often be found in Santa Cruz surfing or hiking/biking around town, up the coast, or in the mountains. Here's me [playing](/img/me-surfing_2019.mp4) in the waves.

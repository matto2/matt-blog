  At FastPencil I made a complete overhaul of the online publishing platform in order to improve the user experience and
  visual design. The added goal was to create a brandable platform that could be licensed to other book sellers who
  wanted to offer their own self-publishing service.</p>

<p>The new dashboard is easily branded and has a simple and clear choice of actions: the primary being starting a new
  project while displaying clear access to all of the user's existing projects.</p>
<p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Books a Million and On Demand Books have have both licensed the platform. They've each done
  some branding as expected but the product experience and much of the look-and-feel remains intact. Also Fast Pencil
  was acquired at this time based on the updated platform offering.
